                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. Introduction of SPORTS FIESTA, a freshers’ tournament that would be conducted over an extended period of about 4-5 days and strengthening the concept of the Women’s Week</h3>

						
<h4>Aim of the program:</h4>
		<p>
- To increase awareness and participation of the UG as well as PG freshers (1st years) at the Inter IIT front
<p>
- To capitalize on the talent pool of the first years more efficiently 
<p>
- To strive harder for the overall awareness and upliftment of sports among women
</p>
<h4>The present scene</h4>
<p>
- Every year a very small fraction of 1st year students make it to the Inter IIT Contingent (less than 10% of 

total contingent size). The main reason for this is accredited to improper channelization and initiation of 

these budding sportspersons towards the sporting culture of IIT KGP.
<p>
- Every year, the Inter Hall tournaments witness brilliant showcase of talent from a number of first year 

students; proving that talent exists among the first years.
<p>
- IIT KGP’s performance could definitely show a marked improvement if proper scouting is done in the initial 

stages.
<p>
- The Women’s Week has shown great potential, though it is yet to achieve its desired heights. Much needs to 
</p>
<h4>Workflow</h4>

<p>
- Registration links would be provided online for the freshers’ tournament. A good estimate of the number of 


students willing to turn up will definitely help in organizing the tournament effectively and efficiently.
<p>

- The senior players from Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence shall assist the Gymkhana secretaries to 

provide for the smooth flow of information regarding the freshers’ tournament. To cater to the post 

graduate students, offline as well as online publicity would be done. 
<p>
- Eminent PG players from each sport shall be contacted to help in increasing participation from the PG halls.
<p>
- Every effort shall be made to conduct separate tournaments for the Post Graduate students 

(considering the number of students turning up), the decision for which would be taken by the PTI 

concerned.
<p>
- The tournament shall be supervised by the concerned PTIs along with the senior Inter IIT players.
<p>
- The tournament shall simultaneously be accompanied with exercise and drills-sessions, lasting for about 4-5 

days, which should be ample for any budding sportsperson to showcase his/her talent.
<p>
- The exact schedule shall be decided by the PTIs and the ex-captains/senior players of each sport 

respectively.
<p>
- The concept of Women’s week has provided a start to the upliftment of sports among women. This year it 

shall be conducted with increased preparations and publicity for each event. The meritorious performers of 

last year’s edition shall be contacted and we expect an increased participation in each of the events.
</p>
	
 <h3>2.Medical assistance for all sportspersons during the Inter IIT camp (in December) by appointment of

professional sports physiotherapists.
</h3>
				<h4>Aim of the program</h4>
<p>

- To cater to the injuries of the players on a daily basis so as to ensure better performance of the players. 
<p>
- To improve the overall performance of IIT Kharagpur contingent at the Inter IIT Sports meet
</p>
<h4>The Present Scene</h4>

<p>
- Injuries among players are more prominent during the winter camp because of the increased frequency and 
<p>
- Every year, a significant number of players from the contingent have to play with injuries at the Meet which 
directly affects the performance of the Inter IIT Contingent as a whole.
</p>
<h4> Work-flow: </h4>
<p>
- Two qualified Physiotherapists (preferably 1 male and 1 female) from Kharagpur/Kolkata would be brought 
<p>
- The Physiotherapists would be provided accommodation at the guest houses in the institute. 
<p>
- They shall be available to address the patients at the BC Roy Technology Hospital during two shifts. 
</p>

<h4>Benefits: </h4>
<p>
- Proper assessment and treatment of players’ injuries shall definitely lead to quick recovery and availability 
<p>
- An improved medical assistance will lead to enhanced performance as well as confidence of the players at 
<p>
- Overall, this would improve the infrastructural amenities for sports.

<h3>3.Conduction of a SWIMMING SURVIVAL CAMP to equip the students with basic swimming and survival
skills, throughout the academic year 2016-2017.
</h3>
			<h4>Aim of the program: </h4>
<p>
- To equip the students with basic swimming skills to help them in emergency situations. 
<p>
- To promote the sport of swimming among the students.
<p>
- Targets the overall well being of the IIT KGP student community
</p>
<h4>The Present Scene:</h4>
<p>
- There have been recent incidents in the past that have thrown light on how the basic knowledge of swimming could have prevented those mishaps. 
<p>
- Swimming is a basic survival skill which will always find implication at some point of time.
<p>
- There has been a lack of awareness among the students regarding the importance of swimming.
<p>
- At present, no such camp is being organized within the institute, which makes it quite necessary to take a 

step towards its initiation.
</p>

<h4>Benefits:</h4>
<p>
- The biggest positive to be extracted from this camp is that students would learn to survive in emergent 
situations, leading to drastically reduced damage to life.
<p>
- Increased awareness and the ability to tackle such situations will altogether drive us to be a smart and safe KGP community.
