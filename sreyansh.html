                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. Technical Week</h3>
						<p><b>Objective: </b>The General Championship has become more competitive over the years; however, it is 
observed that the technical output from the General championship is not that significant. In 
the recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of student intake in IIT 
Kharagpur so in order to provide them with an opportunity to enhance and exhibit their 
technical skills; I propose to introduce a series of workshops specially conducted for the 
first year students. These workshops will be conducted in assistance of the various 
societies in the campus. Hence we would be able to encourage the first year students to go 
ahead and participate in the technology general championships as well. Through this 
proposal, I aim to increase the participation in technology general championship and 
provide the students of the first year an opportunity to enhance and exhibit their technical 
skills. This would also help to increase the postgraduate participation as it would expose 
them to the pattern of the events conducted in the General Championship. 
 
</p>
						<p><b>Timeline</b>
									<p>Tentative Date  ­               August 1st to August 20th,2016

								<p><b>Overall Benefits</b>
									<p>
1. Certification of Participation (COP)​ by Technology Students’ Gymkhana to all 
students who completed the workshop successfully. 
<p>
2.      Through the implementation of the following proposal the students of the first year 
get an opportunity to enhance and exhibit their technical skills and hence we can expect an 
increase in the participation in the events of the Technology General championship 
<p>3.      Also this proposal will ensure that the quality of participation in the General 
Championship will improve over the years. 
<p>4.      It will also help the different societies under the gymkhana to tap potential among the 
first year students.

 <h3>2. Model Village </h3>
						<p><b>Objective:</b>The organisational forms have undergone a constant process of evolution which has 
enabled them to meet part of the growing demand for social, community  care and 
collective services. The Hult Prize is the world’s largest student competition for social good. 
The annual, year­long competition crowd­sources ideas from MBA and college students 
after challenging them to solve a pressing social issue around topics such as food security, 
water access, energy, and education. Through its structured approach to defining the 
challenge and local, regional and global competition rounds, the Hult Prize actively seeks to 
create a new kind of social business. I propose to conduct a similar event “Model Village” to 
enhance the growth of local communities around IIT Kharagpur. Hence, its purpose is to 
add value to the community by solving problems that exist and promote startup culture in 
campus. This event is exclusively for IIT Kharagpur students.  
</p>
						<h4>Similar Competitions</h4>
									<p>
The Kharagpur Indian network 
<p>
Alumni cell 
<p>
Empresario 
<p>
Eureka ,Conquest (Social track) 
<p>
Other international Social Competitions 
</p>

						<h4>Benefits</h4>

<p>
(I change KGP) 
<p>Social impacts 
<p>Technology driven decisions for social causes 
<p>Upliftment of the community  
<p>Incubation and other benefits/prizes 
<p>Recognition by institute and promotion of national and global promotion 
</p>


<h3>3. Identifying Potential KTJ Candidates</h3>
						<p><b>Objective : </b>During December, participants are contacted by team Kshitij for participation 
and submission in events. This happens through calling in the whole database. If there 
exists a mechanism which will decide and tell us the potential participants, we can get the 
desired participation in a more productive way. Algorithmic training helps one identify 
the target data set and reduce the complex and tedious taking into account all the possible 
edge cases. This gives one a quick solution which can be modified upon. I propose to 
identify potential participants and improve productivity and quality of the event 
participation through user rating mechanism with the help of algorithm design by Jon 
Kleinberg. 
</p>
					<h4>Structure</h4>
									<p>There are mainly two features required to achieve the above said objective. 
<p>  
User rating mechanism. (with help from Algorithm design by Jon Kleinberg) 
<p>
Push Notification and response tracking mechanism. 
<p>  
Increasing functionality and popularity of My Ktj 
<p>  
KTJ Feed 
</p>

<h4>User rating mechanism</h4>

During December, participants would be contacted by team Kshitij for participation and 
submission in events. This would mostly happen through calling in the whole database. If
