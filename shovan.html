                      <h3> 1. ‘Career Conclave’ for Placement Preparation </h3>
<p>Placements are one of the most important part of any student’s stay at IIT Kharagpur.
The spring semester before the final year for students should be used to guide students in the methods
of preparation as it will provide a much needed base for students going into the next semester.
Moreover, students have to attend PPTs, apply for companies and give placement tests in the autumn
semester. Thus, they will be able to prepare in a better manner if they already have a strong base and
know what they will be facing. This will also prevent last minute hassle and tension regarding
preparation as well as anticipation and logistics issues as students will now be more assured about the
whole process thus ensuring efficiency and a more confident state of mind.
Prof. Debasis Deb, Chairman, Career Development Centre, also said that students will benefit in
placements immensely if a dedicated method for preparation is developed.</p>
<h4>Proposal</h4>
<p>
A Career Conclave will be organized under the aegis of the Career Development Centre.
I plan to organize preparatory seminars under the aegis of Career Development Centre where the
students sitting for placements will be told of the intricacies of preparing for interviews of the various
sectors including consultancy, finance, core, startups, analytics, research etc. Talks shall be delivered by
alumni/professionals/students concerned with the respective sectors.</p>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
This program will consist of three steps
<h5><u>Step 1: Career path identification </u></h5>
<p>This step consists of a drive in which seven different areas will be covered. Each day will consist of
workshops/webinars conducted by reputed alumni/professionals/students in the respective sectors.
This program is open for pre-final year students. The sectors are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Consulting</li>
<li>Analytics and Coding</li>
<li>Startup-related</li>
<li>Core & Research</li>
<li>Social and Teaching</li>
</ul>
<p>In this conclave, Alumni/ professionals/ students shall deliver the talk through interactive
sessions/webinars. The sectors Finance , consulting, analytics, coding and teaching will have
alumni/professionals/students coming down to Kharagpur to have face to face interaction sessions
since, these domains are not part of regular curriculum.
Core and research Sector will consist of webinars organized individually with respect to the departments
with two different tracks: UG, PG & RS Each webinars will have half an hour lecture or introductory
session followed by a one hour Q & A sessions. The questions for the same will be collected prior to the
webinar, filtered by the CDC team and sent to the speaking alum.<p>
<h5><u>Step 2: Profile Matching and Buddy allocation</u></h5>
<p>Senior Year Buddy (SYB): SYB is a final year student who is placed and still in campus.
This facilitates proper interaction between the buddy and the student. The placement process of
students culminates with him filling a feedback form. His/her interest in buddy program would be
known through this form. Feedback/interest from the students who attended the drive will be matched
with the feedback received after the placement process. After profile matching, the buddy is allocated.
Each student is asked to select two sectors on priority and the allocation will be done by the Career
Development Centre. If the number of students is more than the capacity with respect to number of
buddies then a rotational program is employed in which the students are divided into batches and
interaction happens in different weeks/months. Each buddy will mentor a maximum of 4 - 5 students so
as to ensure that proper attention is provided to the students and that the rotational program can be
avoided.</p>
<p>Experienced Postgraduate and Research Scholar students would also be approached to mentor the
students and provide their valuable input for career choices in research and aligned areas. This will
provide a further opportunity for the students of IIT Kharagpur to learn from each other and appreciate
each other’s expertise.</p>
<h5><u>Step 3: Mentorship</u></h5>
<p>The mentorship period starts from mid-March and as we know the CV submission of the companies start
from the month of August/September. This provides a six month mentorship period before the
placement process. During the mentorship period, the buddy is encouraged to share his experience with
the student and provide him concrete information like sharing reference materials, case practices etc.
Mentorship continues till the end of placement season.</p>

<p>
The Career Conclave will start in the spring semester for people who will be sitting for placements in the
next semester. In that semester, people who have already been placed will conduct these workshops
where the methods used by them in preparing for interviews of various companies and the pattern of
interviews will be explained. These workshops will also include group discussion and personal interview
sessions. There would also be sessions on CV Building, Communication and basic aptitude development.
A survey of placed students conducted by CDC showed that a majority of students felt that problem
solving and communication skills were their major strengths.</p><p>
<!-- Major Hurdles students perceive (As per survey conducted by CDC Post Placements December 2015) -</p>
<ul>
<li>CGPA</li>
<li>Communication Skills</li>
<li>POR</li>
<li>Internship Experience</li>
<li>Help / Advice from seniors</li>
</ul>
<p>Major Strengths students perceive (As per survey conducted by CDC Post Placements December 2015) -</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Solving Skills</li>
<li>Communication Skills</li>
<li>Personal Projects</li>
<li>CGPA</li>
<li>POR</li>
<li>Help/Advice from Seniors</li>
</ul> --><h4> Benefits </h4>
<p>Such an initiative where students will use their experiences to help students who will be sitting for
placements next semester will ensure that they will be well prepared.
By the autumn semester, the students sitting for placements will have a broad idea as to what to expect
in placement interviews and tests. They can gain a first-hand insight into what is the requirement and
expectation of each sector through the workshops and webinars conducted by our Alumni and the
officials from different companies.</p><p>
This is a model that is successfully deployed by IIM Calcutta to aid their students in preparing for
placements, and various IIM Calcutta students have commented that this is one of the most useful
method for preparation as it is very comprehensive.</p><p>
Moreover, KGP has always relied on the culture of seniors helping out juniors. Thus, we should further
this culture so that the entire KGP community benefits from it, and students are fully prepared to face
and overcome one of the most important challenges of their student life.</p>


<h3>2. Undergraduate Research platform </h3>
<h4>Overview and need</h4>
<p>The research that happens at IIT Kharagpur is an important parameter which affects many criteria in
World University Rankings. In the past few years, IIT Kharagpur has increased the emphasis on research
and has aimed to become a top 20 university in the world in the engineering and technology criteria.
One important facet of emphasis on research is to encourage students to come up with their own ideas
and innovate. Students need to be given a platform to work on their own research ideas and come up
with solutions to the various problems present. Once students are given encouragement to pursue their
own ideas, a culture of research will be inculcated in IIT Kharagpur among the undergraduate students
which will highly benefit the students as well as IIT Kharagpur in the long run.
Thus it is very important for the institute to inculcate a culture of research where students’ get to take
up projects on their own research ideas.</p><p>
In the India Rankings 2016 released, IIT Kharagpur was ranked 3rd in the Engineering sector. Director, IIT
Kharagpur was very happy with the result but he also said IIT Kharagpur must make more effective use
of its large student strength at all levels as an asset for growing up the research quality output.
To increase the culture of research among undergraduates, I propose the setting up of ‘Undergraduate
Research Platform’.</p><p>
To encourage Research & Development activities amongst the students, proposals will be invited every
year in the month of August from the Undergraduate Students of IIT Kharagpur. The guiding spirit
behind this initiative is to encourage students to think and innovate. The students should take initiative
in identifying, studying and analyzing problems as well as formulating solutions. Under this scheme,
students are required to submit the project proposal in association with identified faculty of the
Department/Centre to act as an administrative facilitator and a guide. Proposal may be submitted by a
student alone or by maximum of two students.</p><p>
If the project is completed, the students will be issued certification from the institute which will be
beneficial to the students if they want to apply for research internships abroad and for further studies.
So, this initiative is not only beneficial for furthering the pride of this institute, but will also help
encourage and inculcate a spirit of research among the students and will also provide concrete benefits.</p>
<!-- <h4>Timeline</h4>
Announcement of invitation of proposals will be made during August.
Students will be required to submit proposals as per notified duly forwarded by the facilitator(s) and
concerned Head(s) of the Department till end of September.
Shortlisting of proposals will be carried out by the Dean, Undergraduate Studies and a notification will
be made by mid-October regarding the same.
The students will have to start work on the project by the beginning of December and be required to
complete their projects as per notified schedule and submit final report by the end of February.
Students will submit one progress report at the end of December to the facilitator, and a final
completion report at end of February.
Thereafter, the same facilitator evaluates their progress in the project during March, and only those
students, who are found to have completed their work satisfactorily, will be finally awarded.
The successful students can collect their certificates after submitting the certification through their
facilitators that all bills related to the concerned project have been settled during April in the following
year. -->
<h4>Online Portal</h4>
<p>An online portal will be created where students can see the updates related to URP. Also, all the
students can see the work done so far under the initiative of URP. Also, this portal will list the sponsored
projects going on in the institute. Thus, the visibility of these projects will also increase.
This portal will also list all the sponsored research projects on campus to increase the visibility of the
projects happening among the student community.</p>
<h4>Selection criteria</h4><p>
All the proposals will be submitted by the end of September. The facilitator will give the marks to each
of the reports and the top few as decided by the maximum cap will be selected based on the following
criteria : </p><p>
Innovativeness – 20 marks</p><p>
Impact – 20 marks</p><p>
Feasibility – 20 marks</p>
<h4>Award Criteria</h4><p>
Facilitators will submit a report which will recommend whether the student should be awarded the
certification based on the completed report submitted by the students and the work done by them.</p>



<h3> 3. Training of Mess Workers and Setting of Balanced Diet by a Dietician</h3>
<h4>Overview & need</h4><p>
Training of mess workers by professional chefs to deal with the problem of poor quality of cooking, and
getting a dietician to set up a broad guideline for the mess menu so that a healthy and nutritious mess
menu can be chosen by the students.
Poor mess food is a major issue faced by all students of IIT Kharagpur. In my interaction with various
students, many students have complained that the mess food is not properly cooked.
In addition to that as the menu is not decided by a dietician, there is risk of students consuming an
imbalanced diet is high.
The mess problem is a problem faced by everyone and it affects them directly.</p>
<h4>Proposal</h4><p>
I propose that chefs should be called to train the mess workers so that the method of cooking is refined.
They can also check the equipment that is being used and judge whether they are appropriate for a
mess which serves the students of IIT Kharagpur.
As the quality of cooking is a constant complaint of the student, such a move will ensure that a step has
been taken to train the workers. This will mean that the mess workers are now more in touch with what
students expect from the mess and appropriate steps are taken to ensure what the correct method of
cooking a certain type of food is.</p><p>
The presence of a dietician is necessary to decide a basic composition of a healthy diet for a student.
Often what the students decide is not a healthy balance of all the nutrients which can be detrimental
later on in life, as students eat in the mess for a major proportion of the meals that they have in IIT
Kharagpur.
Since it is the job of the mess to provide the students good and healthy food, a proper diet plan must be
set in place. This plan will not be exact, but will have broad guidelines as to which food items should be
present in a necessary balanced meal, and students can now choose among those options for a meal
instead of choosing from all the items that are available to them.
Having a dietician setting up a broad guideline will ensure that such a healthy combination of food items
in a menu is present.
Thus, having training for mess workers will ensure that the poor quality of cooking is handled, and
getting a dietician to set broad guidelines for the menu will ensure that students choose a healthy and
nutritious composition for their mess menu.</p>



<h3>4. Digital KGP</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4><p>
In today’s age, it has become extremely important for any organization to completely move to an IT
enabled administrative infrastructure to reduce the paper trail and increase accountability.
Recently, even the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi recognized the importance of digitization
by launching the ‘Digital India’ initiative to improve the online infrastructure to make services available
to each and every citizen of the country.
In the report commission by the institute to KPMG to suggest reforms for the institute to realize the
goals of ‘Vision 2020’, it was stated that having a completely IT enabled administrative infrastructure is
the key to reduce bureaucratic delays and a major step forward for any campus in reducing the paper
trail and ‘Going Green’. Such an infrastructure is already present in top colleges of the world like
Harvard and Yale.
In cases of hospitals, it has been seen in the recent past that all major hospitals are moving to digital
method of record keeping for patient profile so that the entire case history of patient is instantly
available. In countries like USA, medical records are constantly analysed to detect the outbreak of any
disease.</p>
<h4>Need</h4>
<p>A major issue that the institute faces is that proper medical history of a student is not maintained. Often
students do not use the assigned medical book and use the emergency slips. In this case the record of
the medical history may not be maintained in the medical book of the student, and BC Roy only notes it
down in registers. In case of an emergency, this will result in delays for searching the required record
which may prove to be fatal. There is a need to keep a complete medical history for getting knowledge
of previous medicine subscriptions as well. Moreover, due to lack of any means to quickly analyse data,
timely alerts regarding the spread of contagious diseases cannot be issued. On speaking with Prof
Chhanda Chakraborti, Chairman of BC Roy Technology Hospital and Dr. Seema Roy, Senior Medical
Officer (Administration), BC Roy Technology Hospital, they also agreed that maintaining a patient profile
is extremely necessary.</p><p>
Currently, for submission of forms for issues like guest house booking, swimming pool slots, gym slots,
bona fide certificate, elective change, no dues certificate, application for grade card and various other
facilities available to students, signatures of a various authority figures are required.
This is often a long winding and inconvenient process, which takes up the students’ time unnecessarily.
As most authority figures are available only during office hours of 9 am to 5 pm, often students are
unable to quickly get the bureaucratic work done as they have classes during that time.
As of now, the records for issuing of bonafide certificates, grade cards and other official documents are
maintained in registers. This leads to the admin office maintaining large amounts of paper copies. This is
highly inconvenient when a specific record needs to be searched.
For an institute like ours, which aims to be in the top 20 universities of the world by 2030, all
administrative work should be maintained digitally for better record keeping and convenience. This is
also a major direction in which an institute can reduce the paper consumption and move to a greener
model.</p>
<h4> Proposal & Benefits</h4>
<p>I propose that the process of obtaining the signatures of various authority figures be ported to the
digital medium, where the request for permission is sent to every concerned authority and they are
notified of the same.
This reduces the inconvenience of students, and also makes it easier for record keeping purposes as the
data from the filled form can be automatically recorded once the concerned authorities approve the
application digitally.</p><p>
For example, in the case of a bona fide certificate, the student can submit a request to his faculty
advisor, who may review and approve it and forward it to the Head of Department of the student who
will approve it and send it to the academic section. On receiving an approved application, the academic
section can provide the bona fide certificate to the student.</p><p>
A similar request can be initiated for booking a room in the guest house. In addition to that, students
will be able to see the availability of rooms on the internet itself for the dates they want to book the
rooms, and based on that they can book the rooms.</p><p>
By introducing record keeping on computers in BC Roy Hospital, a complete medical history of the
student can be maintained easily. Thus, a complete patient profile which will have records of previous
visits and subscriptions will be instantly available. Also, since this record will be kept on computers, it
will much easier to sort and analyse the data, through which it can be found out which doctors are the
most in demand and at which time slots is the hospital the busiest. In that manner, steps can be taken to
call in these doctors for more visits and allocate resources in the hospital in a better manner. This was a
major concern of the students as stated in a survey by Awaaz, and this step will help in solving that
problem. Apart from that, timely alerts for contagious disease can be issued if any such pattern is
available in the data that is being recorded.</p>






<h3>5. Regular Workshops in the campus - by different societies over the entire year </h3>
<h4>Overview</h4><p> Yearlong activities on campus by different societies to increase the opportunities available to
students to explore their areas of interest.</p><h4>
Need</h4><p>
Currently, people who are not a part of any of the societies on campus, or even if they are a part of a
few societies on campus, they are unable to explore other avenues of their interest.
Often they also miss out as most societies conduct selection right at the beginning of the year, where
the student is unable to decide what he wants to take.
Even though the General Championship provides a student a platform to do this, it is often not possible
for every person to take part in different events and learn from it.
Students also miss out on a chance to interact regularly batchmates and seniors on a regular basis in a
relaxed environment.</p><h4>
Proposal</h4><p>
I propose that the different societies under the Gymkhana conduct workshops for the students on
campus so that students can explore their interests and gain more exposure.
I have spoken to the Governors of different societies, and most of them are willing to this for the
betterment of the student population on campus.
A structured timeline will be drawn up once I meet with all the Governors next session based on their
other commitments like the introductory workshop and any other outstation commitments. Once the
timeline is decided by the in meeting with the Governors, it will be released via the Gymkhana website
and the Gymkhana page so that students are aware of it from the beginning and the attendance level
does not drop. Room and AV Cell bookings will be provided by the Gymkhana for these workshops.
Benefits</p><p>
Conducting such workshops will ensure that wholesome development of students takes place and
students who are not a part of different societies do not feel left out in terms of making full use of the
various activities that IIT Kharagpur can offer. This is also beneficial to societies as they can spot talent
that may have been missed out during fresher selections.
Students will also get a chance to interact with seniors who have different skillsets. Since workshops will
be conducted throughout the year, more students will come in contact with different people and this
will prove beneficial to them when the time comes when they have to ask for advice regarding
internships/placements.</p><p>
Under this proposal, the different activities that can be conducted are:</p>
<p>
B-Club: B-Club conducts knowledge sessions based on different topics and follows it up with an activity
like a case study, or data interpretation. This will keep the students aware of what is happening around
them and also give them some basic knowledge regarding case studies and data interpretation which
can turn out to be useful in the future.
</p><p>TDS: Open to all workshops will be conducted on select weekends. This way students who are not a part
of TDS, but are still interested in learning how to dance can do so. TDS will also conduct a workshop
before the Amateur Junior Championship that it conducts so that people can learn a few basics and also
take part in the competition.</p><p>
Dramatics: Like the workshop that was conducted this year, similar workshop will be conducted in a
combined manner by all the dramatics societies. Since it will be incorporated in central timeline it will
ensure that clashes with a few events are avoided and the workshop can be conducted in a better and
more structured manner.</p><p>
Music: ETMS and WTMS can conduct open sessions where each session will be dedicated to a particular
specialty, like vocals or a particular instrument.</p><p>
Spectra: Workshops on different art forms and photoshop will be conducted.</p>
