                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. I propose to introduce a 3 day event that shall be named as “Live Your Life!”
that will solely aim at improving the social aspect of student life at IIT
Kharagpur by encouraging them to come up with their problems and
grievances.
</h3>

<p>
Day 1(Intra Hall Open House):
<p>
• The Hall president and Second Senate Member shall conduct an Open House
session with all the hall boarders where various problems faced by them shall be
discussed. Also, a representative from a NGO would visit and encourage the
students to discuss on a particular social issue centred around the theme of Live
Your Life and come up with solutions to tackle it.
<p>
• Observed institute wide between 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM.
<p>
• The students shall assemble in the common ground where the Hall President shall
address them and the Hall may also decide to conduct any event that can elicit
participation of the entire hall population like movie screening, games like
Tambola, Antakshari etc.
<p>
• The minutes of the Open House shall be submitted to the Dean of Student Affairs
and the Vice President, Technology Students’ Gymkhana.
<p>
Day 2(Night OUT Day):
<p>
• Blackout for 2 hours between 8:30 pm and 10:30 pm.
<p>
• Power Supply and LAN to be shut down in every hall.
<p>
• Aim to bring people out of their rooms and communicate with their peers.
<p>
• Light up only few of the common places in the campus where people can
   gather and communicate.
<p>
• Plan surprise events in the Jnan Ghosh stadium in association with
   Technology Dance Society and Technology Dramatics Society.
<p>
Day 3(Yaadein):
<p>
• A big formation shall be made by the graduating batch at the Jnan Ghosh stadium
in the evening that addresses the issue of Substance Abuse with an appropriate
message. This theme will be different for different years based on discussion with
Dean Of Student Affairs and Vice President, Technology Students’ Gymkhana.
<p>
• Photographs of the Formation by the graduating batch shall be included in Imprint
- the annual yearbook and Alankar.
<p>
• The Video of the formation shall be released through the youtube channel of
Technology Students’ Gymkhana- KGP Talks.
<p>
• Director’s Anecdotes: If possible the Director will be interacting informally with
the students at the venue. The session may happen from 6PM-7PM in the evening.

</p>
					
 <h3>2.Since the Star Nights wrap up by 11:00 PM, we are obliged to engage the
participants who are entangled in euphoria. I propose to conduct events which
will go on after the star nights to charm the participants, without any priority
clashes with the competitive events or any hindrance to other people. 
</h3>
						<h4>Benefits</h4>
									<p>Firstly, this caters to the needs of the euphoric gripped students who have no
intention of letting their energy levels drop.
<p> Implementation of this proposal would help us make Spring Fest a 24 x 7
delight by keeping it alive throughout those four days.
<p>Screening of Classic International movies is likely to attract associations of
some highly prestigious international organizations like cultural centers and
libraries of various countries which are keen to share their culture with us.
<p>Alliance Francaise, American Library, Goethe-Institute, Russian Cultural
Centre are some of the active organizations who screen their films in India
through their embassy.
<p> Having an association with organizations of such caliber would definitely
elevate the standards and quality of the fest.
<p> There is no better slot for having Cyber Arena conducted. If the Game is on,
then night it is to accomplish the mission.
<p> A lot of students have been observed to Jam and play informal events like
Antakshari and Dumb Charades throughout the night. Conducting new and
innovative events will add to the splendour of the night life seen in the fest.
<p> A Night Flea Market will be a great opportunity for Spring Fest to associate
with organizations who create brilliant native art and help revive the social
aspect of Spring Fest by helping people remember the forgotten arts.
</p>
			
<h3>3.My third proposal is to introduce a Social and Cultural Weekend exclusive to
only research scholars and post graduate students to efficiently tackle the
problem of low participation in the General Championship Social and Cultural
from the halls having Research Scholars and Post Graduate Students.
</h3>
									<p>
• Participating students shall only be Post Graduate and Research Scholar students of
the institute.
<p>
• The Social and Cultural Weekend shall be a two day affair.
<p>
• The Social and Cultural Weekend shall be organized in the Autumn Semester. The
exact dates shall be communicated by the Technology Students’ Gymkhana after
consultation with the Post Graduate Representative and the Research Scholar
Representative to the Institute Senate.
<p>
• There shall be five events conducted in these two days:
<p>
• Day 1(Saturday) Events:
<p>
- Elocution ( Timings: 10 AM - 12 NOON at Netaji Auditorium)
<p>
- Eastern/Western Vocals ( Timings: 7 PM - 10 PM at Netaji Auditorium)
<p>
• Day 2(Sunday) Events:
<p>
- Dramatics (6 PM-10 PM at Netaji Auditorium)
<p>
- Fine Arts (Timings: 10 AM -1 PM at S-302 or S-301)
<p>
• The performances in the various events shall be covered both through the Facebook
page of Technology Students’ Gymkhana and the youtube channel of Technology
Students’ Gymkhana - KGP Talks.
<p>
• Videos of past Gold winning performances in the Social and Cultural General
Championship events will be screened for the benefit of the participants before the
commencement of the Social and Cultural weekend.
</p>
<h4>Benefits</h4>
• Since this platform is open only to Post Graduate and Research Scholar students, it
will give them a better chance to showcase their talents in the Social and Cultural
genre.
<p>
• This will address the problem of less participation of the Research Scholars and
Post graduate students in the General Championship Social and Cultural.
<p>
• There are events of each genre of the General Championship Social and Cultural in
the Social and Cultural Weekend. This will help them in getting oriented with the
General Championship.
<p>
• The Social and Cultural Weekend can also be used as a platform for proper
information dissemination to the Research Scholars and Post Graduate students
</p>
<h3>4. My fourth proposal is to introduce a Social Case Study Event in the open IIT.
The Problem Statement shall be given by a collaborating NGO who shall also
judge the final entries.
</h3>
						<h4>Benefits</h4>
									<p>
 Helps in making the students in the campus more socially aware.
<p>
• Introduces students to the basic concepts involved in doing a case study that has an
impact on the society.
<p>
• By doing this event, more number of students will be able to learn the concepts
involved in a case study.
<p>
• Will give a boost to the literature enthusiasts of the campus.
<p>
• Practically feasible ideas given as a solution can be implemented by the
participating NGO thus bringing about an actual impact on the society.

</p>

<h3>5. My last proposal is to introduce the concept of a Guerrilla Marketing in Spring
Fest. 
</h3>

<p>Some of the common techniques used are to create creative and intelligent
video advertisements for branding of Spring Fest that would be shared by
everyone due to the fun factor in it. Another popular method is to conduct
interesting informal events with Mall Partners and posting the videos of these
events on our site and Youtube channel. The current publicity via social media
has ensured we convey the vital information to all the followers of Spring Fest.
But through Guerrilla marketing, every post we share makes a deep impression
on the viewer, thereby increasing the publicity as well as increasing the viewer’s
base through repeated sharing.
</p>
						<h4>Benefits</h4>
									<p>

i. Causes exponential growth in viewership. Reaches a large Audience.
<p>
ii. Reduction of Workload. We are just making the Advertisements. People are
advertising it.
<p>
iii. Totally cost free marketing strategy.
<p>
iv. Increases the traffic to the Website, Likes on the Facebook Page and number
of people talking about this.
<p>
v. Leaves a long lasting impression on the viewers.
<p>
vi. Video Advertisements would raise the standards of marketing and publicity
in Social Media which was till now done mainly through posters.
<p>
vii.It would elevate the marketing techniques of Spring Fest above the
contemporary methods followed by other fests.
