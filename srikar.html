                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. I ​propose to initiate a Humor Club​ for the students of IIT Kharagpur under the ambit of the Gymkhana </h3>

									<p>
Comedy as an art form has been gaining massive popularity over the years, and we 
have a sizable portion of the institute populace who would like to engage in this art form. 
Humor is an exciting new topic for the students to explore, and we have many 
enthusiastic and talented students willing to pursue it.  
 <p>
Humor Club is an organization which shall be under the aegis of the  
Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The Club shall run by its members who shall be 
conducting Workshops and open mic nights. The Humor Club shall provide an 
opportunity to all students of the campus to showcase the efforts made by them in ever 
growing performing art of comedy.  

</p>
						<h4>Conceptualization </h4>
<p> 
The reason behind the conceptualization of the Humor club is the opinion of general kgp 
populace. The introduction of Gymkhana activities in the genre of comedy was a 
common suggestion during campaigning as a candidate in various hall days. The 
Humor Club shall serve this purpose.  
<p>
Regarding this proposal,a comprehensive sample survey was conducted among 467 
students across all years and all hall of residence and found out that while 66% of the 
people were supporting the introduction, 11% actually wanted to be active member of 
Humor Club and regularly take part in events and sessions to be  conducted in such a 
Club. The survey clearly shows the eagerness of the students at IIT Kharagpur to 
participate in humor related activities.   
<p> 
Moreover in the academic session 2015­16 a group of enthusiastic students  had 
organised two open mic standup comedy nights like “Live at the Apollo 13” which 
showed great amount of participation as well as crowd appreciation. We have in touch 
with the organisers of the open mic night and they have agreed to take this initiative 
forward along side us.

</p>
<h4>	
Benefits of the Humor Club 
</h4>
 <p>
Providing the students of IIT Kharagpur a chance to showcase and hone their 
talent in the art of standup comedy. 
 <p>
The growing art of comedy shall be finally getting some Gymkhana activities 
dedicated to it. 
  <p>
This shall helps students to improve their public speaking and communication 
skills as well as their confidence. 
 <p>
A successful Humor Club shall ensure the open mic nights becoming landmark 
events in student life at IIT Kharagpur and shall generally have positive outcome 
on student community.

 <h3>2.I​ propose to organise a Freshers’ Cultural Weekend  with the aim of 
introducing to the first year students , the various social and cultural 
activities of technology students’ gymkhana and making them aware 
of competitions like open IIT and general championship​.
</h3>
						<h4>Events</h4>
									<p>
<p> The events comprise of four genres similar to the general championship namely 
creative writing ​ elocution​ and ​under literary genre , ​solo vocals ​ solo instruments 
and ​under entertainment genre, ​solo dance​ dramatic monologue​ and ​ under dramatics genre and sketching under fine arts genre. 
</p>
						<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>The programme would commence on Friday night at 8 pm with the sketching event 
taking place that day. On saturday Creative writing event would take place at 2 pm 
followed by Solo Instrumentals event and would continue till six thirty  in the evening. 
Following a one hour break the Solo Vocals event would commence at 7:30 pm setting 
up a fine musical evening. The Dramatic Monologue event would begin early at 10 in 
the morning on Sunday followed by the elocution event. Finally the Solo Dance event 
would take place in the evening beginning at 6 pm.  
 <p>
The judging would be done by the Governors of the concerned societies for each event. 
Judging for the creative writing event would be done by the governors of the 
Technology Literary Society, while for sketching it would be done by the governors of 
Spectra.  
The instrumentals and the vocals events would be judged by the governors of WTMS 
and ETMS. 
The governors of ETDS, HTDS, BTDS and TTDS would judge the dramatic monologue 
event while the governors of the Technology Dance Society would be judging the solo 
dance event. The governors of their respective societies have been contacted for the 
same. 
<p> 
Under the supervision of the two Gymkhana General Secretaries the programme would 
be managed by the team of the Gymkhana Social and Cultural office bearers namely 
the Literary, Fine and Allied Arts, Entertainment and the Dramatics secretaries. The 
secretaries would manage their respective events and would report to the General 
secretaries.   

<p> 
 
The publicity of the event would be done through email, social media and also by 
personally addressing the wings in the fresher halls.  An email regarding the event 
would be sent through the Vice President, Technology Students’ Gymkhana to all the 
freshers. Social Media publicity will also be done by the Gymkhana office bearers. Apart 
from this the Gymkhana office bearers would be addressing individual wings in the 
fresher halls in order to ensure hundred percent awareness about the event among the 
freshers.  
</p>

<h4>Impact </h4>

<p>
This initiative would provide freshers with a platform at the Gymkhana level to 
experiment with their talents. It is different from the Open IIT and the Inter Hall events 
because of its exclusivity for freshers and  all the events taking place together during a 
short period of time which would ensure efficient management. Freshers who are 
interested in these fields can try out for the events and get hands on experience of the 
Gymkhana level Social and Cultural activities which would better prepare them for the 
GC events. Many of the first years are unable to  participate in the General 
championship either due to lack of awareness or they do not completely know their 
skills. So this fresher’s weekend will be a perfect start for them to discover their prowess 
and hone their skills further.   
<p>
<h3>3. I propose to introduce the following events in Open IIT namely­ Solo dance and Solo 
dramatics. 
</h3>
									<p>
These events shall be introduced in the Open IIT. The Open IIT and General 
Championship lack such events and thus introduction of such events will serve 
as a great motivation for students interested in these activities.  
Solo dance and Solo dramatics provides the students with a platform to display their 
innate individual flair. 
</p>

<h3>4. Proposal for an integrated Adventure complex during spring fest and the sets for 
the respective fun games will be in the open space behind Kalidas auditorium and 
other feasible places in the campus. 
</h3>
						<h4>Events included</h4>
									<p>
This comes under a completely new genre of springfest.These events are completely 
for enjoyment and goodies for the event makes the participants more interested.The 
following are the events. 
 <p>
1. Laser tag 
 <p>
This  requires  a  closed  room.So  appropriate  arrangements  will  be  made  for  the 
event in the parking lot below gargi and  maitree seminar halls. 
 <p>
2. Zorbing 

This  event  does  not  require  a  lot  of  space,  so  possible  venue  can  be  behind 
kalidas auditorium 
 <p>
3. Paint ball 
Paint  ball  requires  a  large space  so  the  open  space behind vikramshila will be 
the perfect spot for the event 
 <p>
4. Human foosball 
Human foosball is a very entertaining game and a small set is required for the game. 
<p>      These events will also appear on the website of spring fest but the registrations will 
be done on the spot. IIT kharagpur students can participate in these events with basic 
fee whereas for the outside participants the fee will be included in the total registration 
fee of Spring Fest.
