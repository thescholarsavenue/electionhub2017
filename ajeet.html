                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. SPORTS MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME</h3>

<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>

To cater to the growing interest in sports and the increasing student population, I plan to introduce a mentorship programme where best athletes in the institute from a sport are chosen and appointed as mentors to teach and help their assigned group of mentees learn the sport. Students interested for any particular programme can register for ​free​. Learning is lot easier when a student like you, who is the best in the field, is helping you out. It will go a long way in promoting the sporting culture across the campus.

</p><h4>
Plan of Action</h4><p>


The mentorship programme will be started at the ​beginning of the academic session​.Student registrations will be free and would be done online. Students will be required to give a preference list of the sport they are interested in. Anyone who is interested in learning the basics of the sport can apply with the limitation of one sport per student. Each Inter­IIT player and probable will have an opportunity to apply as a mentor in this programme. The following sports will be included in the mentorship programme:
</p><p>
Men​:Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey, Swimming, Table Tennis, Tennis, Volleyball, Water Polo, Squash
</p><p>
Women:​Athletics, Badminton, BasketBall, Swimming, Table Tennis, Tennis,
Volleyball
</p>
<p>
At the start of the session, a Beginner’s Camp will be organized and a certain number of players would be shortlisted from the camp (we will try to accommodate as many students as possible). If someone is not shortlisted, he has the option of going to the camp the second sport in his preference list.

A set of guidelines will be provided to the mentor specific to his/her sport. These guidelines will be drafted by the concerned Physical Training Instructors ( PTIs ) and temporary coaches. A mentor will be assigned no more than 5 students.

A feedback mechanism to judge the effectiveness of the mentorship provided by the mentor will be established online, and modifications will be done accordingly.
</p>

<h4>Beginner’s Camp</h4>
<p>
A beginner’s camp will be organized for each sport at the start of the academic session. The​ Secretary will be responsible for the smooth conduction of his concerned Sport’s beginners camp.

Anyone who is willing to learn a sport and has applied to the mentorship programme will be able to attend this Camp.

Special publicity of this camp will be done in ​Research Scholar, Post Graduate and Girl Halls of Residence​,as their participation requires more attention.

There will be a workshop for each sport before the selection of students for the mentorship programme. The respective PTIs and coaches will be the responsible for the selection of the students.

After the selection procedure, the first session of the programme will commence, wherein the PTIs as well as the Inter­IIT players will teach the very basics of the sport.
</p>
 

<h3>2. MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING (WITH A

SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON WOMEN SELF DEFENSE)</h3>

<h4>Proposal</h4>
<p>
Martial Arts not only prepares one for combat in the real world but it also provides an avenue for development of character, self awareness and an active lifestyle. Kung Fu, a form of martial arts can be practiced in dedicated manner as well as a routine exercise.

I propose to organize martial arts training for the all students ( both men and women, UG/PG/RS) of IIT Kharagpur including all the undergraduate, postgraduate and research scholars. There will be however, a specific emphasis on Woman safety and steps will be taken to provide a conducive atmosphere for women in the campus to learn martial arts
</p>



<h4>Benefits</h4>
<ul>


<li>Martial Arts helps in Increasing Self­Esteem and Instills a Sense of Self­Respect. </li>

<li>One of the central tenets of all forms of the martial arts is an absolute focus on self­discipline and one gets accustomed to receiving instant gratification from lessons in self­restraint and discipline.</li>

<li>It helps a person become more aware of the surroundings around him/her.</li>

<li>It helps one boost Socialization Skills which is very essential in corporate life.</li>

<li>The obvious and most important reason for a girl to get involved in the martial arts is the capacity for self­defense that she will develop. In today’s increasingly violent world, crime can strike anywhere. Women are often times the target of sex crimes and, not knowing how to defend themselves, it can scar a young girl for her entire life. Being able to know how to defend herself is an invaluable tool as she grows up, taking her skills with her to college, and it gives not only her but also her parents a feeling that at least their daughter is safe.</li>

</ul>


<h3>3. LIVE STREAMING OF MATCHES </h3>
<h4>


Proposal</h4>
<p>

In a perfect sport, all results are possible, and in the mad scramble to victory, or defeat, there is delight, horror and humour. I propose for the live streaming of international cricket and football matches for IIT Kharagpur students at Netaji Auditorium so that the IIT Kharagpur community can also  experience the competitive spirit of the sport and enjoy it together in a grand way. </p>

<h3> 4. SPECIFIC AND SEPERATE SPORTS WEEK </h3>
<h4>Proposal</h4>

<p>
To increase the participation of Women, Research Scholars and Post­Graduate Students in the Institute, I propose to organize a separate Sports’ Week for Women and Research Scholar & Post­Graduate Students in the Institute.The sports week will spread awareness about each sport and will serve as a motivation for players to take up the sport seriously.
