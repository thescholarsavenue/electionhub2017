<h3>2. PROVIDING NECESSARY EQUIPMENTS FOR ALL THE PARTICIPATING HALLS OF 

RESIDENCE FOR DRAMATICS EVENTS </h3>

<p>I propose to provide a centralised system of equipment that remain common to all the participating Halls of 

Residence.
<p>
It is known that every year during the dramatics events various participating halls arrange for the extra 

equipment. Hence, I propose to install new equipment for the dramatics events of the General Championship 

under Technology Students’ Gymkhana as a onetime investment, listed as follows: 
<p>
1) Babies: 5 are already installed but are of very poor quality 
<p>
2) Side Spots of greater intensity 
<p>
3) LED lights / babies different from the normal babies 
<p>
4) Flicker ( At most 1 )
<p>
5) Smoke machine ( at least 2 )
<p>
6) Collar mic ( 3 for Netaji Auditorium )
<p>
7) Hand mic at least 5 
</p>
<h4>Budget:</h4>
<p>
1. Babies (Required 6) = Rs. 4500 per piece
<p>
2. Spots (Required 4) = Rs. 6800 per piece
<p>
3. Flicker Lights (Required 1) = Rs. 4000 per piece
<p>
4. Smoke machine (Required 2) = Rs. 5000 per piece
<p>
5. Collar Mic (Required 3) = Rs. 3500 per piece
<p>
6. Hand Mic (Required 5) = Rs. 2200 per piece
<p>
Total – Rs. 89,700 only
</p>
<h4>Benefits:</h4>

<p>1. It is a onetime investment.

<p>2. It is handy.

<p>3. It can be used by other societies as well.

<p>4. Repeated expenditure for every event will be avoided
</p>
<h3>3. INTRODUCTION OF CULINARY ARTS FEST IN SPRING FEST 2017</h3> 
<p>
I propose to introduce Culinary Arts Festival in Spring Fest 2017.
<p>
<h4>FEATURES:</h4>

<p>1. To feature a variety of local and one nationally/internationally known Chef / Chocolatier / Baker.
</p>
<h4>BENEFITS :</h4>
<p>
1. Food Fest will add a new dimension to the standard Spring Fest format. 
<p>
2. This would give festival attendees an entirely unique festival experience, each attendee taking home 
<p>
an once-in-a-lifetime memory.
<p>
3. The horizon of the participants attending the Spring Fest will expand.
