                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                      <h3> 1. IT Cell</h3>
                      <h4> Proposal </h4><p>
I propose to create an IT Cell, a student body which would work to improve the processes involved in pursuing various curricular and extra-curricular activities by the integration of technology. The cell would provide technological solutions for various issues faced by the students. The solutions will enhance the productivity of the student and administering bodies involved in undertaking these processes while making the processes hassle free for the student community. The body will consist of students selected on the basis of merit and shall work under the supervision of a Professor In-Charge.</p>
<h4>Need</h4>
<p>There are multiple avenues relating to student community of IIT Kharagpur which are in a serious need of digitalization for carrying out their operations efficiently. There is a constant need of developing new applications to cater to the rising needs of general populace of IIT Kharagpur in both curricular and extra - curricular domains. There is a need to bring transparency in matters concerning monetary transactions pertaining to student funds.</p>
<h4>Solution</h4><p>
Formation of an IT Cell, a student body with proper technical expertise to build, scale and manage digital solutions to address long-standing problems of the student community. The IT Cell will utilize the immense potential of the students of IIT Kharagpur who can excel in the field of application development, product design and product management, by building permanent solutions to the problems faced by themselves as well as their peers.</p>



<h3>2. Online Mess</h3>
<h4>Proposal</h4><p>
I propose to introduce an online mess system to provide the students a facility to avail the option
of choosing additional food items and paying only for what they eat outside the basic* menu
which will be decided by the Hall Management Centre. Students of various halls of residence
can fill up their options online on a common portal deciding what all they want to eat and pay
only for their selection. Also, a common portal system will simplify accounting of the expenses
involved along with enhanced monitoring by both, hall council and HMC.
It will empower the students to choose what they want to eat and pay for the same.</p>
<h4>Requirement</h4><p>
Most halls of residence have a system in which the record of additional food consumed by each
student is maintained manually in a register and the sum is calculated at the end of every
semester. The current procedure does not provide the flexibility to not pay for a particular food
item apart from the basic menu which the student does not want to eat at all. Hence sometimes
students end up paying for something they donâ€™t eat the whole semester. Upon implementation
of this proposal through a dedicated online portal, students will get the freedom to pay for what
they eat, check and schedule their mess expenses. This will also ensure a more systematic,
reliable and automatic accounting procedure. Since the mess workers will be pre-informed
about the quantity of the food needed, there will be not be a problem of shortage or excess of
food.</p>




<h3> 3. Graduate Studies Cell </h3>
<h4> Proposal </h4><p>
I propose to form a Graduate Studies Cell under the Chairman-Career Development Centre to foster Research and Development amongst both the undergraduate and postgraduate students in established research universities and laboratories in both India and abroad. The cell would help the undergraduate students get more opportunities for foreign internships. The postgraduate students currently pursuing masters would be able to secure PhD opportunities and PhD students would be able to acquire post doctoral positions under internationally renowned Professors. This cell would streamline the application process as well as help in efficient information dissemination of various opportunities for students who are not looking for corporate jobs. The cell would also organize Guest talks and interactive workshop sessions by eminent personalities in research thus promoting Research culture in the campus. Need: CDC is not just for Placements and Internships but for developing careers of KGP students in a holistic way, be it a full time role in an Industry or further studies. Graduate studies cell encourages students of IIT Kharagpur towards a career in research which forms an integral part of career development.</p>
<p>There is a clear need for the formation of a Graduate Studies Cell which would help students to have a hassle free application procedure through a Centralized channel. The Institute is working extensively towards improving Research activity in the campus. The introduction of Graduate Studies Cell can also engage the Institute in Research collaborations with Universities in India and abroad. Solution: Formation of Graduate studies Cell to foster the Research interest for students in different departments. Also the cell would create a hassle free application procedure for the ones
interested. The cell will utilize the potential of motivated students with relevant expertise and a strong desire to serve their peers in the department in fetching research internship positions abroad. </p>



<h3>4. Application that includes all students-concerning activities on campus </h3>
<h4> Proposal </h4>
<p>
I propose to create an application to bring about all the information regarding any of the students concerning activities on campus on a single platform. Not only fulfilling the essential need of aggregating the information, but also presenting it in an organized, user friendly manner so as for the user to make full use of it. The application will also function as an effective means of communication between the various groups to their targeted students. The application will also contain various other features focused on allowing users to organize and receive the information according to their choice/preference and constraints. </p>
<h4>Need</h4><p>
There are multiple online and offline channels across the IIT Kharagpur campus for information dissemination regarding the plethora of activities that take place in campus. The number of such channels is high, thus making it difficult for users to keep track of activities leaving them with high chances of missing out on many. The first year undergraduate, postgraduate and research scholars who in general are not very acquainted with the already existing number of channels accurately fit the mentioned need.</p>
<h4>Primary Beneficiaries</h4><p>
First year students of IIT Kharagpur, being new to campus are not aware of the activities of societies and student groups. They come across a huge amount of information about such events, but most of the times fail to decide whether a particular event is suited for them to attend as a first year or not.
Final year students who have a plenty of time to spend, are very choosy about the events they want to attend to and thus need specific information about the activities they are looking for.
Both the user profiles mentioned can be catered by the properly structured and customized information which will be provided by the Information Dissemination System.</p>





<h3>5. Online portal for booking doctor appointments at BC Roy Hospital & Annual Students' Health Service Scheme </h3>
<h4>Proposal</h4><p>
I propose to create an online portal for booking doctor appointments at the BC Roy Technology Hospital for ease of access. The newly formed IT cell can be tasked to create the portal. I also propose to introduce an annual Studentsâ€™ Health Service Scheme to promote the physical, mental and social well being of students of IIT Kharagpur. These preventive health check-ups will facilitate the detection of latent diseases and their subsequent treatments for the students to help them compare the progression of their health year over year. There shall also be awareness programme regarding common diseases occurring at this age.
</p>
<h4>Need</h4><p>
Health and fitness of the KGP fraternity is a major part of the well being of the community. But the current systems in place have not kept pace with the technological advancements. A lot of minor medical issues are ignored by students which lead to serious consequences as time progresses. An annual health check-up would help in detecting and treating such issues well in time. The awareness programmes will motivate
students to take precautions and preventive steps in order to avoid major medical issues.
</p><p>
The addition of an online appointment booking portal helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li> To improve the efficiency and ease of the overall process of seeking medical attention and reduce time while waiting in long queues for specialised doctors </li>
</ul>
<h4> Implementation </h4>
<ul>
<li> The online portal can be made in collaboration with IT Cell, IIT Kharagpur</li>
<li> For people of the KGP community with restricted internet access, the BC Roy Hospital will have on-spot appointment booking as well, which would be entered in the database in real time.</li>
</ul>
