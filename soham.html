                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. Implementing an open Cultural Development Program</h3>
						<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>

 <p>

IIT Kharagpur is renowned as an Institution of excellence due its academic merit and 

holistic development of individual personalities. Societies and groups have successfully 

represented IIT Kharagpur in a variety of competitive events. However, it has been 

recognized that the breadth and quality achieved in cultural activities have not reached a 

broad audience in the campus. The latent potential of the student community has not been 

tapped or recognised, often by the students themselves, simply because they lack a 

platform where they are free to explore and recognise their own passions.
<p>
 

To bridge this gap, I propose to organise a Cultural Development Program, open to all 

students of IIT Kharagpur, where each interested student is accepted into a high-quality, 

well-defined series of workshops, co-organized by experienced members of the student 

community, societies and outside professionals, under the able guidance of Professors. The 

workshops serve the dual purpose of initiating the participants into different cultural 

activities, and training them towards exploiting their own capabilities.
</p>
 

<h4>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>

 
<p>
The workshops will be divided into four cultural genres, with each genre having a series of 

regularly-held workshops under their ambit. The genres, determined by popular mandate, 

are:

 

<p>● Literary genre

<p>● Dramatics genre

<p>● Dance genre

<p>● Fine Arts and Photography genre

 

<p>Each genre will involve the conduction of four workshops at regular intervals, culminating 

in a competitive or collaborative event, or a production involving all participants.

 

<p>  WS1: Introduce the participants to the activities and initiate their practice for the same. Co-

ordinated with the societies and experienced student participants.

<p>  WS2 and WS3: Headed by experienced members of the student community, and/or the 

requisite societies respectively.

<p>   WS4: Headed by professionals with substantial experience in the respective cultural genre, 

whose invitation to the campus shall be co-ordinated in conjunction with the requisite 

societies involved.

 
<p>
Preliminary registrations for the Cultural Development Program shall begin on April 15, 

2016 and continue till August 20, 2016, enabling a broad-ranged reach that cuts across the 

student community. The fees for this Program shall be kept nominal, to ensure that the 

Program is affordable and widely accessible, with an exact amount to be finally determined 

after consulting with the respective authorities and stakeholders..

 

The Program’s workshop series shall subsequently begin, keeping in mind the official 

schedule of holidays of the Institute while simultaneously maintaining flexibility for the 

participants with respect to their academic requirements. The four periods of time devoted 

for this purpose, in the Autumn semester of the academic session 2016 – 2017, are as 

follows:

 

<p>● August 21 - September 5

<p>● September 22 - October 6

<p>● October 17 - October 31

<p>● November 1 - November 15

The official schedule shall be intimated to all registered participants prior to the initiation 

of the Cultural Development Program.
</p>
 

<h4>IMPACT AND LEGACY</h4>

 

<p>The Cultural Development Program entails a series of benefits for the student community 

of IIT Kharagpur. The expanded outreach of cultural activities increases awareness 

regarding their extent, quality and impact, and hence improves visibility amongst the 

students. Simultaneously, the societies themselves can benefit from a more interested and 

aware student community, propelling them to newer heights and ultimately benefiting IIT 

Kharagpur as an Institution.
<p>
 

Equally important is the perspective of the participating students. Through the workshops, 

they are given the opportunity to continuously engage with each other and with well-

 experienced individuals for optimum results of self-improvement and awareness. This is 

also tremendously beneficial in further diversifying the skills that students gain, which are 

becoming increasingly important and relevant today.

 
<p>
As a long-term proposal, the evolving legacy of the Cultural Development Program is far-

reaching. Once the starting point is passed, the ethos of the Program can go ahead and 

become an integral fibre of campus life and excellence, furthering the strength and 

capability of the student community as a whole.
</p>
 
 

 

<h3>2. Addition of digital counterparts of 

existing events, and the inclusion of a new event in the Cup.
</h3>
 

<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>

<p>The Fine Arts Cup is one of the four genre cups of the Social and Cultural General 

Championship, involving the conduction of five events – Sketching, Collaging, Postering, 

Cartooning, and Thermocol and Clay Modelling. While these events have remained staple 

features of the General Championship for many years, with a strong history of participation 

and quality results on topics often themed on social motives, they have not evolved in 

nature to accommodate for the varying needs of today’s digital world.

<p>To bring forward the quality, scope and current relevance and applicability of the events of 

the Fine Arts Cup, I propose to expand the events of Cartooning and Sketching so as to 

include both traditional and digital production formats. This would increase the imparting 

of requisite skillset to participants, ensuring that they are well-tuned to modern and in-

demand qualities, with a healthy basis of knowledge in the same. The Fine Arts Cup will be 

rounded out by the inclusion of a photography event as well.
<p>
<h4>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>

<p>The two events whose scope will be enlarged, Cartooning and Sketching, shall now be 

composed of two distinct elements:

<p>● A standard, hand-drawn submission based on the given topic

<p>● A computer-based digital submission based on the specific topic

<p>Both elements shall count towards the final scoring for each Hall of Residence, the scores 

being the cumulative totals of scores from all the submissions made from the participants 

of each Hall of Residence. Thus, the events will test the participants on both hand and 

digital skills, thus demanding greater effort and increased variety of implementation.

<p>The digital segments of the above events shall be conducted at a suitable venue, the precise 

location of which shall depend on availability of possible computer laboratory facilities as 

well as the decision of the Fine and Allied Arts subcommittee. Judging for the event, 

however, will be singular and comprehensive across both submission formats.

<p>In addition to the above modifications to the events, a new event shall be included in the 

Fine Arts Cup, called the Photography event. The event will be a submission-based event, 

with a specified deadline and a mandated time period of occurrence. The event shall be 

initiated when the judge releases the theme for the event, on the basis of which 

participants shall make and assess their submissions. Being an individual execution, the 

photography event would be an Individual event of 60 points.

<p>Each Hall of Residence shall submit five photographs for perusal to the judges. Each 

photograph shall be evaluated on the following factors:

<p>● Relevance to theme

<p>● Uniqueness of perspective

<p>● Quality of detail

<p>The final score for each Hall of Residence shall be the cumulative total score obtained from 

each submitted photograph. A time period of one month shall be allotted for this event, 

with any requisite changes to be determined in the subcommittee.</p>

<p>All submissions must be made in the JPEG format, and must be directly submitted to the 

Secretary, Fine and Allied Arts Subcommittee. To ensure logistical consistency and 

elimination of potentially fraudulent entries, the General Championship shall co-ordinate 

with Spring Fest to uphold quality standards and prevent infractions on intellectual 

property rights, thus ensuring a fair, comprehensive scope of participation that shall 

further improve the relevance and scope of the Fine Arts Cup.</p>

 

 

 

 

<h3>3. “Realizing vision 2020 through one of its transformational 

initiative, ie, branding and visibility”</h3>

 

<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>

 

<p>Life at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur is exceptional due to its long standing 

culture. The life entails participation in society events, events in the General 

Championships and inter-institute competitions across the country. As stated in the</p> 

<h4>“Vision 20-20”</h4>

<p>“ A strong and distinctive culture is important as it supports and unifies the university as a 

brand, and is aligned to the vision, mission and purpose of the institution.”<p>

Keeping this in mind I think that the activities of our students has two problems 

<p>1.) It is not all pervasive

<p>2.) People outside our institute have no way of knowing about this rich culture which 

keeps it limited to our Institute and doesn’t permit it to grow into a brand by itself

<p>In order to address the second issue I think that we need to publicize such events taking 

place within our institute with a much greater zeal and gusto than is being done in the 

present scenario. To that effect I propose that we maintain a powerful presence on the 

social media and the internet. </p>

<h4>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>

<p>The ways in which this is going to be implemented are several:

<p>● An active Youtube channel showcasing the society events (such as drama 

productions, Debates, Music productions, etc.), the events of the General 

Championships throughout the year and signature events like the Illumination.

<p>● An active facebook page that showcases these events and posts updates actively 

along with photographs accompanying events and teasers and short video clips 

taken from the event.<p>

● A twitter account to assert the presence of the cultural wing of our institute on the 

social media.<p>

● A blog called with frequent posts about incidences in the events presenting the 

backstories that encircle every event.

<p>All these efforts will be very coherent meaning that the facebook page and twitter will 

compliment the youtube channel. With the assistance of the Gymkhana Photography 

secretary, we will proceed to click snapshots of our best performances as well as complete 

videos. The relevant links and information shall be regularly available on the Gymkhana 

website.</p>

 

<h4>IMPACT AND LEGACY</h4>

 <p>It will be my earnest endeavour, if I am elected to the post of General Secretary, Social and 

Cultural, to coordinate with my team and keep all the pages, channels and websites fully 

updated. I am sure, that the talent and the effort showcased during the General 

Championship events will leave an indelible impression on everyone. The increased 

visibility will help reveal our multifaceted skillset to the entire world. This will not only add 

to the glory of our institute and ensure due recognition to the performers it will also set our 

institute apart from most other institutes across the world attracting students from across 

the world. This will go a long way in achieving excellence in creating a holistic environment 

which is in line with the motto of Vision 20-20</p>
