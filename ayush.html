                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. 
I propose to implement a Sports For All mission with the vision of further improving culture of sporting fraternity at IIT Kharagpur with the ulterior vision of improving our position in the Inter IIT General championship through involving freshers with a more holistic approach and improving the chemistry within the players of different halls of residence.
</h3>

<p>
The total number of students in IIT Kharagpur is around 11,200 of which the postgraduate students and the research scholars constitute around 4500 while the number of Freshers in the institute is over 2000.
Despite their high numbers the postgraduate students and the research scholars constituted only 10% of the Inter IIT Sports Meet contingent of IIT Kharagpur, while the freshers made up less than 10%.
Hence it is clear that there is sparse participation from the research scholar and the postgraduate side and a structured plan is of paramount importance to increase the same. Moreover since the only format of conduction of team sports is at an inter-hall level it is necessary to build teams with players from different halls of residence since this will build better chemistry and camaraderie between the sportspersons of IIT Kharagpur.
</p>

 <p>
The aim of the proposal is: 
To enable inter­IIT players to choose a diet according to their individual nutritional 
needs. 
</p>
 
<p>
A.  Conduction of a Freshers’ Introductory seminar for the undergraduate and postgraduate students and to introduce them to  the varied opportunities and the rich sporting culture that IIT kharagpur has to offer.
<p>
B.  Completion of Inter IIT trials at an earlier date so as to absorb Freshers as well as other students and start off with Inter IIT Practice sessions earlier.
<p>
C. Introduction of a new Tournament called SPORTATHON for team sports, involving teams with players from different halls of residence.

</p>
<p>
<b>Benefits and Impact:</b>
Due to the lack of Open IIT events with proper logistical structure, the fresh talent in  team sports is rarely unearthed at an early stage. As a consequence of the proposed tournament the talented freshers can be a part of teams  with the more experienced seniors which will not only help uncover their talents but also hone them further.  
<p> 
The tournament along with the proposed preponement of the date of Inter IIT trials shall ensure that practices of the team sports are conducted from an earlier date and with a high level of motivation since the players would have to perform in a competitive environment. 
<p>
Such a tournament in which teams can be constituted of players from different halls of residence would improve the chemistry between players coming from different halls and consequently the overall bonding within the Inter IIT contingent. 
A competitive and structured tournament can serve to motivate the postgraduate students and research scholars to practice more diligently and perform better.
</p>

<h3>2.I propose to initiate a Bridge Club and a Chess Club under the ambit of Technology Students’ Gymkhana. 
</h3>
 

<p>Chess and Bridge constitute ten of the hundred and fifty points of the Inter-Hall Sports and Games General Championship and see active participation from various halls of residence. However, these two games do not have any events in the Inter IIT Sports Meet and no outstation participation of students representing IIT Kharagpur at any level. 
<p>
As a result it is necessary to start the two clubs which promote these two games. Bridge Club and Chess Club shall be organizations under the aegis of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The clubs shall be run by the respective members which shall conduct regular sessions, intra-KGP tournaments, workshops as well as be involved in outstation competitions and events. 


</p>

<h4>Conceptualization</h4>

<p> 
The reason behind the conceptualization of the Chess and the Bridge Clubs is the lack of proper events under the ambit  of the Gymkhana for these two games. The only Gymkhana involvement of these two sports are the respective Inter-Hall General Championship events. The introduction of events in these two games was a common suggestion during campaigning in various hall days.  The Bridge and Chess clubs shall serve this purpose.  
In a sample survey conducted among ninety seven students who are active participants in the two games, an overwhelming 92% lauded the initiative and agreed with the necessity of the proposed introduction

</p>

<h4>Activities</h4>

<p>
The above two clubs shall conduct various activities related to the respective games.
<p>
Regular sessions : The Chess and Bridge clubs shall conduct regular open sessions at stipulated times. The structure followed shall be one with open membership  similar to the one followed by Technology Quiz Club. These sessions would include practice matches, strategy discussions etc.  
<p>
Workshops : The clubs can conduct workshops and classes on Chess and Bridge to spread awareness among students having  formal training in these games. Professionals from Kolkata or Medinapore can be brought in to conduct special workshops.
<p>
Outstation Participation : The clubs shall participate in invitational tournaments in nearby places like Kolkata and Medinapore. This will enable the prominent players of IIT Kharagpur to represent the college externally.  
</p>

<h4>Benefits of Chess and Bridge Clubs</h4>
<p>
Providing the students of IIT Kharagpur a chance to showcase and hone their talent in Bridge and Chess.
<p>
Indoor games like these shall be finally getting some Gymkhana activities dedicated to them apart from the Inter-Hall events. 
 <p>
The workshops that shall be conducted shall make even more people aware of these games and increase the quantity and quality of participation.
</p>

<h3>3. I propose to initiate an Adventure Weekend wherein we can have workshops of various adventure/lifestyle sports for example skating,cycling,free running as well as incorporation of fun events like Paint ball, Zorbing etc. 
This may  be done in collaboration with the Technology Adventure Society,the official adventure sports Gymkhana society of IIT Kharagpur. 
</h3>

<h4>Overview: </h4>
<p>The Adventure weekend shall be conducted to create awareness as well as enthusiasm about offbeat adventure sports like skating,roller blading,free running etc. as well as create an enthusiastic environment in the campus by incorporation of fun events based on adventure and excitement like Paintball and Zorbing.
</p>

<h4>Budgeting: </h4>
<p>This can be done in association with Technology Adventure Society who will be conducting the events as well as handling the logistics.The budget for this event shall be included into the budget of the Technology Adventure Society and shall be increased by a suitable amount as well. To ensure that the weekend remains cost effective for the  Gymkhana,the fun events can include an entrance fee.However the workshops shall remain free of cost for the students.
</p>

<h4>Benefits and Impact:  </h4>
<p>a. This will create awareness and enthusiasm among the students of IIT kharagpur about such sports and as an alternate avenue to conventional sports with a mission to remain fit and active.
<p>b.An integrated weekend like this shall ensure that there is proper publicity within the campus to generate and sustain a buzz throughout the entire weekend.
<p>c. The fun activities incorporated shall ensure enthusiastic participation from the students and shall give them a much needed break from their monotonous academic life.
</p>

<h4>References:</h4>
<p>We have been in touch with certain organisations of adventure sports like parkour bengal,Leisure sports management(Kolkata) and dewdrops rollerskating club regarding association. we have gotten a particularly enthusiastic response from Mr.Indrajit Dey of Parkour bengal who has already visited IIT Kharagpur on a recce.
We have also discussed the possibility of association with the governors of Technology Adventure Society and they have expressed their interest to engage in further talks.
