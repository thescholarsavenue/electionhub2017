                        <h2>Proposals</h2>
                        <h3>1. Workshops</h3>
						<p><b>Objective and Proposal : </b>To provide the IIT Kharagpur student populace about the latest trends and requirements of the industry to keep them placement ready, I propose to initiate short term course and workshops for Data Analytics in association of KDAG(Kharagpur Data Analytics Group) and for Finance and Consulting in association with B­Club whose primary objective will be to provide the students with opportunities to learn and get a professional flavour about the above mentioned fields which will help them in Placement and Internships immensely. The workshops would specially be focused on the students who have registered for placements.  
</p>
						<h4><b>Stucture</b></h4>
						<p><b>Core</b>
									<p>Similar interactive sessions with professors of respective departments on Thursday/Friday (every weekend). 
Tentative Start Date:­1st Week of August (Once in a week, 2­3 hrs, according to the convenience of the professors).
End Date: ­ 1st week October (before DP vacations).
Already approved by professors of Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical, Mining. Others will be contacted soon. 
</p>
								<p><b>Data Analytics</b>
									<p>An initial registration to gain an idea of the number of people interested in the workshops which 
would take place in the Spring Semester.  
The workshops would be organized in the month of August where in the first week workshops 
would be held 3 days a week (A weekday along with Saturday and Sunday), to make them familiar 
with the basics of data analytics, following which an assignment would be given every week. The 
assignments would have to be submitted weekly in groups of 5.  
In the 2nd​ week, 3rd​ and 4th​ week, a similar system would follow as the first week.  
The Open IIT Data Analytics, would be organized in the month of September which would serve as 
an assessment of the workshop. We’d be complementing this set with a blog series of KDAG which 
would be updated with the best content about the topics being covered along with interaction 
sessions with alumni who have worked in analytics related positions and seniors who have done 
internships in this sector. 
</p>

								<p><b>Finance and Consulting</b>
 <p>Similar workshops would be organized, in association with B­Club for consulting and finance 
topics. Workshops on topics like the Financial Risk Management and Chartered Financial Analyst 
exam in order to enable students to choose a path best suited to them would be organized.  Along 
with this, an IIT Kharagpur Casebook would be in collaboration with B­Club, with experiences of 
the alumni placed in consulting companies being covered in the casebook. This casebook would 
attempt to be an exhaustive collection of cases that are asked by companies coming for 
placements. Solution as per the placed students and professors would attempt to show a path of 
solution for the given cases.  
Registration:­ Autumn Semester( Tentative 15 th Nov/2 nd week of Nov) 
Jan 1st Week:­ One Open House(Sat) followed by Workshop(Sunday) on weekends 
Jan 2nd Week:­ Workshops (both Saturday & Sunday) 
Jan 3rd Week:­ Workshops (both Saturday & Sunday) 
Jan 4th Week:­ Overnight Case Study Competition 
</p>

<p><b>Quantitative Aptitude </b>
<p>An online collaborative portal wherein the placed students would share the references, videos 
used and books they referred to while preparing for the placements would be set­up. Along with 
this, in association with Career Launcher sessions would be organized to prepare the students for 
quantitative and numerical aptitude tests. In this reference, I have spoken to the Head, Marketing, 
Career Launcher who is enthusiastic about an association with the Gymkhana who has confirmed 
the association of Career Launcher.   
</p>
 <h3>2. Competitive Coding in Technology GC</h3>
						<p>To continue making the Technology General Championship events innovative and relevant, I 
propose to provide an impetus to the coding culture in Kharagpur by including a competitive 
coding event in the General Championship. This event would be along the lines of Code­fun­do 
organized by Microsoft. 
</p>
						<h4>Structure</h4>
									<p>The event will take place tentatively in the 2nd​ weekend of January with a duration of 24­-48 hours. 
The event would be conducted on a platform like HackerRank/HackerEarth in a closed event 
format where only invited teams would be able to compete. 2 teams  from each hall would 
participate and the winner would be declared by including the score of the teams from each hall.  
In addition to that, I propose that the two events namely open Soft and Chemquest be shifted to 
autumn semester. This will help in reducing the crowding up of events in the month of March 
which leads to much chaos. This event is different from the currently existing Open Soft event as 
Open Soft focuses majorly on software development while this event would focus specifically on 
coding skills similar to Hackathons that are organized wherein a solution has to be delivered in a 
very short period of time.  The problem statements would be provided by external companies. 
This event would result not only in the increase of the coding culture but promote participation in 
competitive coding events throughout the year.  
</p>

<h3>3. International Summit on Lines of SAARC</h3>
						<p><b>Vision : </b>Considering the progress Kshitij has made over the past few years, it is imperative for us, the 
students of IIT Kharagpur, to take this symposium to a level higher, by involving participation from 
foreign countries and making IIT Kharagpur a hub for international discussions as proposed in the 
Vision 20­20 plan of the institute.  
</p>
						<p><b>Proposal</b>
									<p>With this vision in mind, I propose to organize an International Summit on the lines of SAARC. The 
international summit will be a part of Kshitij 2016 and will be dedicated to economic, 
technological, social, and cultural development emphasising collective self­reliance. This will 
involve participation from Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and 
Afghanistan. 
The summit would be at student level. Two student delegates from top universities from each 
country will be invited from different universities and organisations. 
</p>

						</p>

<h4>Objectives of the Summit</h4>
<p>
1.  To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, cultural, technical 
and scientific fields between universities of different countries. 
<p>
2.  To associate with various international and regional organizations to acknowledge the 
contribution of the students in addressing the issues of the summit. 
<p>
3.  To promote Kshitij to an international level, as it is one of the largest techno­management 
symposium of Asia. 
<p>
4.  The outcome of this summit will be documented and a copy will be sent to the Ministry of External 
Affairs. Hence, the ideas suggested by the students delegates will be taken into consideration. 
</p>

<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>
Top universities of each country will be contacted and two student delegates will be from a 
 university will be invited to attend the 3­day summit. 
T​he summit will focus on the burning issues which these countries are facing, and which could be 
resolved through international collaborations. These topics of international and regional concern 
will be raised in the summit and the student delegates will discuss them.  
       The summit would be conducted in the Gargi­ Maitreyee Seminar Room in the Vikramshila 
Complex of IIT Kharagpur. he summit would be portrayed as an initiative of IIT Kharagpur in collaboration with Team Kshitij.
